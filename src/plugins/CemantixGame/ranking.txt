Cemantix Game Ranking System Documentation
==========================================

Ranking Structure:
------------------
The ranking system will have 5 main ranks, each divided into 3 tiers:

1. Bronze (I, II, III)
2. Silver (I, II, III) 
3. Gold (I, II, III)
4. Platinum (I, II, III)
5. Master (I, II, III)

Ranking Progression:
--------------------
- Players start at Bronze III
- Progress is based on a modified ELO system
- Points are gained/lost based on:
  * Accuracy of guesses
  * Number of attempts
  * Time taken to solve
  * Difficulty of words

Ranking Points:
---------------
- Each rank requires 100 points to progress
- Tiers within a rank require:
  * Tier III: 0-33 points
  * Tier II: 34-66 points
  * Tier I: 67-99 points
